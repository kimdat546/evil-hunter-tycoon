# AI-Powered Hero Tycoon - Comprehensive Development Plan

## Core Concept: "Hero Master Simulator"
You're the Master managing a guild of AI-powered heroes who live, work, and grow independently in a procedurally generated world using **PixiJS + Node.js architecture** for maximum flexibility and performance.

## üåç World Generation System

### Account Creation Process
1. Player creates account ‚Üí AI generates unique world (OpenAI/Claude API)
2. World includes: terrain, dungeons, monster spawns, resource nodes
3. Generates 5-12 starting heroes with unique personalities
4. Each hero gets backstory, goals, relationships, quirks

### Procedural World Elements
- **Biomes**: Forest, Mountains, Desert, Swamp (each with unique monsters/resources)
- **Points of Interest**: Ancient ruins, dragon lairs, merchant towns
- **Dynamic Events**: Monster invasions, festivals, natural disasters
- **Resource Distribution**: Mines, herb patches, magical springs

## ü§ñ AI Hero System

### Hero Generation Template
```json
{
  "name": "AI-generated",
  "class": "Berserker/Ranger/Paladin/Sorcerer",
  "personality": {
    "traits": ["Brave", "Greedy", "Lazy", "Perfectionist"],
    "motivation": "Glory/Wealth/Knowledge/Protection",
    "mood_tendency": "Optimistic/Pessimistic/Neutral"
  },
  "abilities": {
    "combat_preference": "Aggressive/Defensive/Balanced",
    "learning_speed": "Fast/Average/Slow",
    "social_skills": "Charismatic/Average/Antisocial"
  },
  "backstory": "AI-generated 2-3 sentence history",
  "goals": ["Short-term", "Long-term", "Secret ambition"],
  "relationships": "Friendship/rivalry with other heroes"
}
```

### Independent AI Hero Behaviors
- **Training**: Choose skills to improve based on personality
- **Socializing**: Form friendships/rivalries with other heroes  
- **Shopping**: Buy equipment they want (not always optimal)
- **Exploration**: Discover new areas based on curiosity/bravery
- **Rest**: Take breaks when tired/stressed
- **Hobbies**: Develop interests (crafting, gambling, studying)

### Decision-Making AI System
```
Hero evaluates: Current needs ‚Üí Available options ‚Üí Personality filter ‚Üí Action
Example: Low health + Brave personality = "Fight anyway" vs Cautious = "Rest first"
```

## üéÆ Master Gameplay Mechanics

### Master Powers & Limitations

**What You CAN Do:**
- **Guild Management**: Build facilities (training rooms, shops, taverns)
- **Contracts**: Post bounties and quests for heroes
- **Resource Allocation**: Decide budget for equipment/upgrades
- **Guidance**: Suggest actions (heroes may ignore based on personality)
- **Mediation**: Resolve conflicts between heroes
- **Strategic Planning**: Set guild focus (exploration, combat, trade)

**What You CANNOT Do:**
- Direct control of heroes in combat
- Force heroes to do specific actions
- Change hero personalities (they evolve naturally)
- Micromanage daily activities

### Influence System
```
Master Influence = Trust + Respect + Fear
- Trust: Built through keeping promises, fair treatment
- Respect: Earned through successful leadership, results  
- Fear: Gained through punishment, but reduces creativity
```

### Master Tools
- **Guild Policies**: "Focus on training", "Prioritize safety", "Maximize profit"
- **Reward System**: Bonuses for achievements, penalties for failures
- **Facility Upgrades**: Better training = faster hero growth
- **Information Network**: Scouts report world events, opportunities

## üß† Advanced AI Personality System

### Personality Traits (Each 0-100 scale)
- **Courage**: Willingness to fight strong enemies
- **Greed**: Desire for money/loot vs helping others
- **Loyalty**: How much they trust/obey the Master
- **Curiosity**: Exploration vs staying in safe areas
- **Ambition**: Personal goals vs team objectives
- **Patience**: Training thoroughly vs rushing into action
- **Empathy**: Helping wounded allies vs self-preservation

### Dynamic Personality Evolution
Heroes change over time based on experiences:
```
Successful battles ‚Üí +Courage, +Confidence
Betrayed by ally ‚Üí -Trust, +Suspicion  
Master breaks promise ‚Üí -Loyalty
Finds rare treasure ‚Üí +Greed, +Exploration urge
Ally dies ‚Üí -Risk-taking, +Caution
```

### Hero Relationship Matrix
**Friendship System:**
- Compatible personalities become friends
- Friends fight better together (+15% combat bonus)
- Friends share resources willingly
- Friends may refuse quests that separate them

**Rivalry System:**  
- Opposing personalities create tension
- Rivals compete for Master's attention
- Rivalry can motivate improvement (+skill growth)
- May refuse to work together without Master intervention

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture (Updated for PixiJS)

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: PixiJS + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase free tier)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)
- **AI**: OpenAI/Claude API for content generation

### Core Systems Architecture
```typescript
// 1. Game Engine (PixiJS)
class GameEngine {
    app: PIXI.Application;
    worldRenderer: WorldRenderer;
    heroSystem: HeroSystem;
    aiIntegration: AIService;
    serverSync: ServerSync;
}

// 2. Server-Side World Simulator
class WorldSimulator {
    heroes: Map<string, Hero>;
    worldState: WorldState;
    aiDecisionEngine: DecisionEngine;
    
    // Runs 24/7, simulates offline progress
    simulateWorld(): void;
}

// 3. Hero AI Decision System
class HeroAI {
    personality: PersonalitySystem;
    decisionEngine: DecisionEngine;
    memorySystem: MemorySystem;
    relationshipManager: RelationshipManager;
    goalSystem: GoalSystem;
}
```

### Data Storage Strategy
- **PostgreSQL**: Hero stats, world data, relationships, activity logs
- **JSON Config**: Personality templates, world generation rules
- **Real-time**: Hero decisions, current activities via Socket.io
- **AI Cache**: Common AI responses to reduce API costs

### AI Integration Points

**World Generation (Account Creation):**
```typescript
async generateWorld(playerId: string): Promise<WorldData> {
    const prompt = `Generate a fantasy world with 4 biomes, resource locations, 
    landmarks, and starting conditions for a hero management game...`;
    
    const aiResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
    });
    
    return parseWorldData(aiResponse.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

**Hero Summoning (Player Action):**
```typescript
async summonHero(worldContext: WorldData): Promise<HeroData> {
    const prompt = `Create a unique hero for this world context: ${worldContext}. 
    Include name, class, personality traits, backstory, and starting goals...`;
    
    const aiResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4", 
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
    });
    
    return parseHeroData(aiResponse.choices[0].message.content);
}
```
