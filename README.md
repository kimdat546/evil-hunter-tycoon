# AI Hero Tycoon

A revolutionary web-based tycoon game where you manage a guild of AI-powered heroes who live, work, and grow independently in a procedurally generated world. Built with PixiJS, Node.js, and powered by AI for truly unique gameplay experiences.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Manage your own hero guild where each hero has a unique AI-generated personality, makes independent decisions, and continues working even when you're offline. Your role as the Master is to guide, influence, and manage these autonomous heroes rather than directly controlling them.

### Key Features
- **Living Heroes**: AI-powered heroes with unique personalities that evolve over time
- **Persistent World**: Heroes continue working and the world evolves 24/7, even offline
- **Emergent Storytelling**: Hero relationships and decisions create unscripted narratives
- **Master Influence System**: Build Trust, Respect, and manage Fear to guide your heroes
- **Procedural Content**: Each world is unique, generated by AI at account creation

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm 10.x or higher
- PostgreSQL 15.x (or Supabase account)
- Git 2.x

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.development` file:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/hero_tycoon
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
CLAUDE_API_KEY=claude-your-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
SOCKET_PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd ai-hero-tycoon

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database
npm run db:migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run dev          # Start both client and server in development
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run test suite
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking
npm run db:migrate   # Run database migrations
npm run db:seed      # Seed database with sample data
```

## 🎯 Core Game Systems

### Hero AI System
Each hero operates with a sophisticated AI system:
- **Personality Traits**: 7 core traits (Courage, Greed, Loyalty, Curiosity, Ambition, Patience, Empathy)
- **Decision Engine**: Evaluates options based on personality and current state
- **Memory System**: Heroes remember past experiences and learn from them
- **Relationship Management**: Heroes form friendships and rivalries naturally

### Master Influence System
Your relationship with each hero affects their behavior:
- **Trust**: Built through keeping promises and fair treatment
- **Respect**: Earned through successful leadership and results
- **Fear**: Can be effective but reduces hero creativity and happiness

### Persistent World Engine
The game world continues even when you're offline:
- **Server Simulation**: Heroes make decisions every 5-10 minutes
- **Activity Logging**: All actions are recorded for offline progress
- **World Events**: Dynamic events affect all heroes and the guild
- **Resource Generation**: Resources accumulate based on hero activities

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **Client Performance**: 60+ FPS with 100+ heroes on screen
- **Server Performance**: Support 1000+ concurrent players
- **Database Performance**: Sub-100ms query response times
- **AI Integration**: Minimize API costs while maintaining quality
